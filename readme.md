# CF-UDF

CF / Lucee UDF (User Defined Functions) from various sources

## Requirement

- Most of them should work for all CF & Lucee versions with no issue.

## Usage
- Each UDF has its own folder, named in a way of #Source#-#UDF#
    - For example: cflib-stringFind => The "StringFind" UDF is from [cflib.org](https://cflib.org)
- Browse each of the UDF folder - the index.cfm in there contains the info on how to use the UDF as well as a demo/example.
- To use the UDF, just copy the UDF file xxx.cfm and \<cfinclude\> it in your codes.
